### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, we will be able to do the following:

  -  Given an unsorted array of numbers, generate a sorted array of numbers by applying Quick Sort.
  - Given an unsorted array of numbers, we will understand how to partition an array. This is an important concept in Quick Sort which is used recursively on the partitioned arrays to sort the numbers.
